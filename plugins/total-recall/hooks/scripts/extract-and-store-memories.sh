EXTRACT_PROMPT='You are reviewing a Claude Code session transcript. Extract 0-3 distinct, reusable learnings worth storing as persistent memories.

For each learning output a JSON object on a single line:
{"title": "...", "content": "## Executive Summary\n\n...", "tags": [...], "category": "...", "importanceScore": 0.0-1.0}

Only output JSON lines. No prose. If nothing is worth storing, output nothing.

Rules:
- Only store things with long-term reuse value
- Include WHY, not just WHAT
- Do not store ephemeral task details'

# Extract via `claude -p` (valid), then write each JSON line straight to the vault.
# store-learning.cjs validates JSON, slugifies, and skips existing memories.
